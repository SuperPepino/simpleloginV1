# Simple Login

A simple backend login system including a mailing system and multiple access levels.

Currently 2 access levels, level 1 for normal users and level 10 for admins

Use setup instead of login to set it up and use the setup user to promote your own account to clearance level 10 to be able to use it yourself.

I will try to update this program once in a while so I have a changelog aswel.
